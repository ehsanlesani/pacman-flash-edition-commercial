# 🎮 PACMAN Flash Edition – Commercial Release

🎬 [Watch Demo Video](https://besparweb.com/pacman_game)

This game is powered by a **new custom hybrid AI algorithm** designed and implemented by me, combining multiple existing AI techniques into a novel decision-making system for enemy agents.  
It was originally developed as part of my undergraduate thesis in 2016, and now restructured for commercial and educational presentation.

📄 A comprehensive PDF document is included, containing full technical documentation and design rationale.  
🎓 The project also serves as an educational resource for learning about game logic, agent behavior, and Flash-based development.

🧠 The core AI algorithm used in this game is scheduled for academic publication.  
It is a lightweight, high-performance, surprise-oriented decision-making system designed for real-time agent behavior in grid-based environments.  
The algorithm will be featured in a state-of-the-art research paper with industrial relevance, covering applications in game AI, robotics, and decentralized multi-agent coordination.

🧩 The game features **three levels**, each with increasing complexity and strategic challenge.

## 🧠 Background

Originally developed as part of my B.Sc. thesis in Computer Engineering, this game introduced me to game logic, UI design, and event-driven programming.  
Now restructured and published as a commercial-style project to showcase legacy-to-professional transformation.

## 🚀 Features

- Custom maze and ghost behavior
- Fruit collection and level progression
- Score tracking and life system
- Flash-based UI with interactive menus
